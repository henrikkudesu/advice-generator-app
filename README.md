### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
- [Advice Slip JSON API](https://api.adviceslip.com/)

### What I learned

I put into practice the merging of html, css and pure javascript, as well as making calls through online API.

### Continued development
In the future I will improve the code and try to make it as elegant as possible, especially the css.

## Possible Issues
It will be necessary to disable caching in some browsers, some of them will not return new advice when you click the button.

Example: In Firefox, open Inspect Element, go to the Network tab and disable the cache. 

I will search for some solution for this so you don't have to disable the cache manually. Or not.
